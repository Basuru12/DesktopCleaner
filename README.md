# ðŸ“‚ File Sorter Script

A simple Python script that automatically organizes files in the current directory into folders based on their file type.

## âœ¨ Features
- Organizes files into predefined folders (Excel, Text Files, Images, Documents, PDFs, Filmora, etc.)
- Case-insensitive extension matching (e.g., `.JPG` and `.jpg` are treated the same)
- Automatically creates folders if they donâ€™t exist
- Prevents overwriting files by renaming duplicates (e.g., `file (1).txt`)
- Works with any folder you run it from

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure
When you run the script, it will create (if missing) these folders in the current directory:

- `Excel` â†’ `.xlsx`
- `textFiles` â†’ `.txt`
- `PNGimages` â†’ `.png`
- `Documents` â†’ `.docx`
- `JPGimages` â†’ `.jpg`, `.jpeg`
- `PDFfiles` â†’ `.pdf`
- `Filmora` â†’ `.wfp`
